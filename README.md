# Ladakh Bazaar App

A simple, low-bandwidth marketplace app for Ladakh.

## Features
- **Buy & Sell**: Connect with local buyers and sellers.
- **Offline Friendly**: Work even with slow or no internet (caches viewed items).
- **Direct Contact**: One-tap Call and WhatsApp buttons.
- **Local Focus**: Tailored locations (Leh, Kargil, Nubra) and categories.

## Prerequisites
1.  **Flutter SDK** installed.
2.  **Firebase Account**.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate Platform Code (IMPORTANT)
Since this project was generated by AI, the Android/iOS folders might be missing.
Run this command **FIRST**:
```bash
flutter create .
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run this command in the project folder to download all required packages:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure Firebase (Crucial Step!)
This app requires a Firebase project to run.
1.  Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project.
3.  Add an **Android App** (package name: `com.example.ladakh_app` - check `android/app/build.gradle` to match).
4.  Download the `google-services.json` file.
5.  Place `google-services.json` inside the `android/app/` folder.

### 3. Run the App
Connect your Android phone or emulator and run:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Troubleshooting
-   **"No Firebase App"**: Ensure `google-services.json` is in the correct folder (`android/app/`).
-   **"Multidex Error"**: If you see a multidex error, enable multidex in `android/app/build.gradle`.

## Project Structure
-   `lib/main.dart`: App entry point.
-   `lib/screens/`: UI Screens (Home, Detail, Post).
-   `lib/services/`: Firebase logic.
-   `lib/models/`: Data models.

## App Icon 🎨
An app icon has been generated for you (Orange background with Mountain/Bag).
1.  Check the `artifacts` folder or ask the assistant to show it.
2.  Use a site like [appicon.co](https://appicon.co/) to generate the `mipmap` folders.
3.  Replace the folders in `android/app/src/main/res/`.
